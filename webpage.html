Obasanjo is always antagonizing Yorubas. In December 2010, an old Egba man who belonged to the same society with Obasanjo and my late dad confided in me. That was after the death of Olori Oluwo. The Chief said Obasanjo was interested in replacing their late leader but they will never allowed him for his anti Yoruba stand. The man told me Obasanjo mother was traced to come from IBO land. That was 2010 December.<br><br>Obasanjo, at his age has no business in London. He is too old for that frivolous journey. If he wanted to see Wike, Obi and Atiku he can invite them to Abeokuta.<br><br> This is not the first time Wike, Makinde, Ikpeazu will be in Europe together. The last time, they were in Turkey. This time in London. Tinubu travelled a day or two days earlier to Europe (France first &amp; other places) before Wike travelled on both occasions. It was a private personal meeting leaked to the public unlike the persuasion or pleading meeting of Atiku, Obi &amp; Obasanjo who went to London to Seek Wike and plead with him. Tinubu did not go to London to seek or look for Wike or plead with him. Obasanjo as an old man has no business in London. He was probably invited by Atiku &amp; Obi camps to London to scuttle any arrangement between Tinubu and Wike. <br><br>Tinubu does not have their time. When you see Obasanjo, Atiku and Obi going to meet Wike in London less than 72 hours after Tinubu and Wike were absent at NBA conference, you know they are jittery and intimidated.</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt116128939">2 Likes </b> <b id='shb116128939'></b><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="116129145"></a><a name="msg116129145"></a><a name="7303293.68"></a><a href="/7303293/dele-alake-why-some-people/2#116129145">Re: Dele Alake: Why Some People Are Jealous Of Bola Tinubu</a> by <a href="/yourfavorite21"  class=user title ="Location: Abuja">YourFavorite21</a>: <span class=s><b>8:08am</b></span><tr><td id="pb116129145" class="l w pd"><div class=narrow>How will somebody be jealous of a shaky old man , and his Boko haram partner, its a only stupid, worthless  and Block-Headed olodo ,without conscience that will vote Apc come 2023.<br><br>#FullyObidient <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cool.png" alt="cool" border="0" class="faces"></div><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="116129244"></a><a name="msg116129244"></a><a name="7303293.69"></a><a href="/7303293/dele-alake-why-some-people/2#116129244">Re: Dele Alake: Why Some People Are Jealous Of Bola Tinubu</a> by <a href="/etrouble"  class=user>etrouble</a>: <span class=s><b>8:15am</b></span><tr><td id="pb116129244" class="l w pd"><div class=narrow><blockquote><a href=/post/116119128><b>JASONjnr</a></b>:<br>No sane human will be jealous of an old BAT looking for youths to feed Agbado and Cassava on a daily ....<br><br>Dude's old and senile...
